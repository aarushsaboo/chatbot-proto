This code is used for creating a Streamlit application that allows users to book museum tickets. 
The application collects user information such as name, email, age, number of tickets, and chosen museum. 
It validates the user input and inserts the booking details into a MySQL database table called 'ticket_bookings'. 
The application also provides an option to fill in the booking form manually or interactively with the AI assistant. 
The AI assistant helps users by providing suggestions and explanations for invalid or unclear input. 
The application uses the Gemini API for natural language processing to interact with the AI assistant.
